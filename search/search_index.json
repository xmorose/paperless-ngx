This matching algorithm tries to assign tags, correspondents, document types, and storage paths to your documents based on how you have already assigned these on existing documents. It uses a neural network under the hood.</p> <p>If, for example, all your bank statements of your account 123 at the Bank of America are tagged with the tag \"bofa123\" and the matching algorithm of this tag is set to Auto, this neural network will examine your documents and automatically learn when to assign this tag.</p> <p>Paperless tries to hide much of the involved complexity with this approach. However, there are a couple caveats you need to keep in mind when using this feature:</p> <ul> <li>Changes to your documents are not immediately reflected by the   matching algorithm. The neural network needs to be trained on your   documents after changes. Paperless periodically (default: once each   hour) checks for changes and does this automatically for you.</li> <li>The Auto matching algorithm only takes documents into account which   are NOT placed in your inbox (i.e. have any inbox tags assigned to   them). This ensures that the neural network only learns from   documents which you have correctly tagged before.</li> <li>The matching algorithm can only work if there is a correlation   between the tag, correspondent, document type, or storage path and   the document itself. Your bank statements usually contain your bank   account number and the name of the bank, so this works reasonably   well, However, tags such as \"TODO\" cannot be automatically   assigned.</li> <li>The matching algorithm needs a reasonable number of documents to   identify when to assign tags, correspondents, storage paths, and   types. If one out of a thousand documents has the correspondent   \"Very obscure web shop I bought something five years ago\", it will   probably not assign this correspondent automatically if you buy   something from them again. The more documents, the better.</li> <li>Paperless also needs a reasonable amount of negative examples to   decide when not to assign a certain tag, correspondent, document   type, or storage path. This will usually be the case as you start   filling up paperless with documents. Example: If all your documents   are either from \"Webshop\" and \"Bank\", paperless will assign one   of these correspondents to ANY new document, if both are set to   automatic matching.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"advanced_usage/#consume-hooks","title":"Hooking into the consumption process","text":"<p>Sometimes you may want to do something arbitrary whenever a document is consumed.

However, if you wish to name your files differently, you can do that by adjusting the <code>PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT</code> configuration option. Paperless adds the correct file extension e.g. <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.jpg</code> automatically.</p> <p>This variable allows you to configure the filename (folders are allowed) using placeholders. For example, configuring this to</p> <pre><code>PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT={created_year}/{correspondent}/{title}\n</code></pre> <p>will create a directory structure as follows:</p> <pre><code>2019/\n  My bank/\n    Statement January.pdf\n    Statement February.pdf\n2020/\n  My bank/\n    Statement January.pdf\n    Letter.pdf\n    Letter_01.pdf\n  Shoe store/\n    My new shoes.pdf\n</code></pre>  <p>Warning</p> <p>Do not manually move your files in the media folder.

This is the safest option.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>skip_noarchive</code>: In addition to skip, paperless won't create     an archived version of your documents when it finds any text in     them. This is useful if you don't want to have two     almost-identical versions of your digital documents in the media     folder. This is the fastest option.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>redo</code>: Paperless will OCR all pages of your documents and     attempt to replace any existing text layers with new text. This     will be useful for documents from scanners that already     performed OCR with insufficient results. It will also perform     OCR on purely digital documents.</p> <p>This option may fail on some documents that have features that cannot be removed, such as forms. In this case, the text from the document is used instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>force</code>: Paperless rasterizes your documents, converting any     text into images and puts the OCRed text on top. This works for     all documents, however, the resulting document may be     significantly larger and text won't appear as sharp when zoomed     in.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The default is <code>skip</code>, which only performs OCR when necessary and always creates archived documents.</p> <p>Read more about this in the OCRmyPDF documentation.</p>  <code>PAPERLESS_OCR_CLEAN=&lt;mode&gt;</code>  <p>Tells paperless to use <code>unpaper</code> to clean any input document before sending it to tesseract.

See the API reference of OCRmyPDF for valid parameters. All command line options are supported, but they use underscores instead of dashes.</p>  <p>Warning</p> <p>Paperless has been tested to work with the OCR options provided above. There are many options that are incompatible with each other, so specifying invalid options may prevent paperless from consuming any documents.</p>  <p>Specify arguments as a JSON dictionary.

In order to do that, you need to write the parser itself and announce its existence to paperless.</p> <p>The parser itself must extend <code>documents.parsers.DocumentParser</code> and must implement the methods <code>parse</code> and <code>get_thumbnail</code>. You can provide your own implementation to <code>get_date</code> if you don't want to rely on paperless' default date guessing mechanisms.</p> <pre><code>class MyCustomParser(DocumentParser):\n\n    def parse(self, document_path, mime_type):\n        # This method does not return anything. Rather, you should assign\n        # whatever you got from the document to the following fields:\n\n        # The content of the document.\n        self.text = \"content\"\n\n        # Optional: path to a PDF document that you created from the original.\n        self.archive_path = os.path.join(self.tempdir, \"archived.pdf\")\n\n        # Optional: \"created\" date of the document.\n        self.date = get_created_from_metadata(document_path)\n\n    def get_thumbnail(self, document_path, mime_type):\n        # This should return the path to a thumbnail you created for this\n        # document.\n        return os.path.join(self.tempdir, \"thumb.webp\")\n</code></pre> <p>If you encounter any issues during parsing, raise a <code>documents.parsers.ParseError</code>.</p> <p>The <code>self.tempdir</code> directory is a temporary directory that is guaranteed to be empty and removed after consumption finished.

The keys are the mime types your   parser supports and the value is the default file extension that   paperless should use when storing files and serving them for   download.

See configuration for details.     Edit the included <code>paperless.conf</code> and adjust the settings to your     needs. Required settings for getting     paperless running are:</p> <ul> <li><code>PAPERLESS_REDIS</code> should point to your redis server, such as   . <li><code>PAPERLESS_DBENGINE</code> optional, and should be one of <code>postgres</code>,   <code>mariadb</code>, or <code>sqlite</code></li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_DBHOST</code> should be the hostname on which your   PostgreSQL server is running. Do not configure this to use   SQLite instead. Also configure port, database name, user and   password as necessary.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR</code> should point to a folder which   paperless should watch for documents. You might want to have   this somewhere else. Likewise, <code>PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR</code> and   <code>PAPERLESS_MEDIA_ROOT</code> define where paperless stores its data.   If you like, you can point both to the same directory.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY</code> should be a random sequence of   characters. It's used for authentication. Failure to do so   allows third parties to forge authentication credentials.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_URL</code> if you are behind a reverse proxy. This should   point to your domain. Please see   configuration for more   information.</li>  <p>Many more adjustments can be made to paperless, especially the OCR part. The following options are recommended for everyone:</p> <ul> <li>Set <code>PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE</code> to the language most of your   documents are written in.</li> <li>Set <code>PAPERLESS_TIME_ZONE</code> to your local time zone.</li> </ul>  <li> <p>Create the following directories if they are missing:</p> <ul> <li><code>/opt/paperless/media</code></li> <li><code>/opt/paperless/data</code></li> <li><code>/opt/paperless/consume</code></li> </ul> <p>Adjust as necessary if you configured different folders. Ensure that the paperless user has write permissions for every one of these folders with</p> <pre><code>ls -l -d /opt/paperless/media\n</code></pre> <p>If needed, change the owner with</p> <pre><code>sudo chown paperless:paperless /opt/paperless/media\nsudo chown paperless:paperless /opt/paperless/data\nsudo chown paperless:paperless /opt/paperless/consume\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install python requirements from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file. It is     up to you if you wish to use a virtual environment or not. First you     should update your pip, so it gets the actual packages.</p> <pre><code>sudo -Hu paperless pip3 install --upgrade pip\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sudo -Hu paperless pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>This will install all python dependencies in the home directory of the new paperless user.</p> </li> <li> <p>Go to <code>/opt/paperless/src</code>, and execute the following commands:</p> <pre><code># This creates the database schema.\nsudo -Hu paperless python3 manage.py migrate\n\n# This creates your first paperless user\nsudo -Hu paperless python3 manage.py createsuperuser\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Optional: Test that paperless is working by executing</p> <pre><code># This collects static files from paperless and django.\nsudo -Hu paperless python3 manage.py runserver\n</code></pre> <p>and pointing your browser to http://localhost:8000 if accessing from the same devices on which paperless is installed. If accessing from another machine, set up systemd services. You may need to set <code>PAPERLESS_DEBUG=true</code> in order for the development server to work normally in your browser.</p>  <p>Warning</p> <p>This is a development server which should not be used in production. It is not audited for security and performance is inferior to production ready web servers.</p>   <p>Tip</p> <p>This will not start the consumer. Paperless does this in a separate process.</p>  </li> <li> <p>Setup systemd services to run paperless automatically. You may use     the service definition files included in the <code>scripts</code> folder as a     starting point.</p> <p>Paperless needs the <code>webserver</code> script to run the webserver, the <code>consumer</code> script to watch the input folder, <code>taskqueue</code> for the background workers used to handle things like document consumption and the <code>scheduler</code> script to run tasks such as email checking at certain times .</p>  <p>Note</p> <p>The <code>socket</code> script enables <code>gunicorn</code> to run on port 80 without root privileges. For this you need to uncomment the <code>Require=paperless-webserver.socket</code> in the <code>webserver</code> script and configure <code>gunicorn</code> to listen on port 80 (see <code>paperless/gunicorn.conf.py</code>).</p>  <p>You may need to adjust the path to the <code>gunicorn</code> executable. This will be installed as part of the python dependencies, and is either located in the <code>bin</code> folder of your virtual environment, or in <code>~/.local/bin/</code> if no virtual environment is used.</p> <p>These services rely on redis and optionally the database server, but don't need to be started in any particular order. The example files depend on redis being started. If you use a database server, you should add additional dependencies.</p>  <p>Warning</p> <p>The included scripts run a <code>gunicorn</code> standalone server, which is fine for running paperless. It does support SSL, however, the documentation of GUnicorn states that you should use a proxy server in front of gunicorn instead.</p> <p>For instructions on how to use nginx for that, see the instructions below.</p>   <p>Warning</p> <p>If celery won't start (check with <code>sudo systemctl status paperless-task-queue.service</code> for paperless-task-queue.service and paperless-scheduler.service ) you need to change the path in the files. Example: <code>ExecStart=/opt/paperless/.local/bin/celery --app paperless worker --loglevel INFO</code></p>  </li> <li> <p>Optional: Install a samba server and make the consumption folder     available as a network share.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure ImageMagick to allow processing of PDF documents. Most     distributions have this disabled by default, since PDF documents can     contain malware. If you don't do this, paperless will fall back to     ghostscript for certain steps such as thumbnail generation.</p> <p>Edit <code>/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml</code> and adjust</p> <pre><code>&lt;policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"PDF\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>to</p> <pre><code>&lt;policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"read|write\" pattern=\"PDF\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Optional: Install the     jbig2enc     encoder. This will reduce the size of generated PDF documents.     You'll most likely need to compile this by yourself, because this     software has been patented until around 2017 and binary packages are     not available for most distributions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: If using the NLTK machine learning processing (see     <code>PAPERLESS_ENABLE_NLTK</code> in configuration for details),     download the NLTK data for the Snowball     Stemmer, Stopwords and Punkt tokenizer to your     <code>PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR/nltk</code>.

The mail consumer can be configured via the frontend settings (/settings/mail) in the following manner:</p> <ol> <li>Define e-mail accounts.</li> <li>Define mail rules for your account.</li> </ol> <p>These rules perform the following:</p> <ol> <li>Connect to the mail server.</li> <li>Fetch all matching mails (as defined by folder, maximum age and the     filters)</li> <li>Check if there are any consumable attachments.</li> <li>If so, instruct paperless to consume the attachments and optionally     use the metadata provided in the rule for the new document.</li> <li>If documents were consumed from a mail, the rule action is performed     on that mail.</li> </ol> <p>Paperless will completely ignore mails that do not match your filters. It will also only perform the action on mails that it has consumed documents from.</p> <p>The actions all ensure that the same mail is not consumed twice by different means. These are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Delete: Immediately deletes mail that paperless has consumed   documents from. Use with caution.</li> <li>Mark as read: Mark consumed mail as read. Paperless will not   consume documents from already read mails. If you read a mail before   paperless sees it, it will be ignored.</li> <li>Flag: Sets the 'important' flag on mails with consumed   documents. Paperless will not consume flagged mails.</li> <li>Move to folder: Moves consumed mails out of the way so that   paperless wont consume them again.</li> <li>Add custom Tag: Adds a custom tag to mails with consumed   documents (the IMAP standard calls these \"keywords\"). Paperless   will not consume mails already tagged. Not all mail servers support   this feature!</li> </ul>  <p>Warning</p> <p>The mail consumer will perform these actions on all mails it has consumed documents from. Keep in mind that the actual consumption process may fail for some reason, leaving you with missing documents in paperless.</p>   <p>Note</p> <p>With the correct set of rules, you can completely automate your email documents. Create rules for every correspondent you receive digital documents from and paperless will read them automatically. The default action \"mark as read\" is pretty tame and will not cause any damage or data loss whatsoever.</p> <p>You can also setup a special folder in your mail account for paperless and use your favorite mail client to move to be consumed mails into that folder automatically or manually and tell paperless to move them to yet another folder after consumption. It's up to you.</p>   <p>Note</p> <p>When defining a mail rule with a folder, you may need to try different characters to define how the sub-folders are separated. Common values include \".\", \"/\" or \"|\", but this varies by the mail server. Check the documentation for your mail server. In the event of an error fetching mail from a certain folder, check the Paperless logs. When a folder is not located, Paperless will attempt to list all folders found in the account to the Paperless logs.</p>   <p>Note</p> <p>Paperless will process the rules in the order defined in the admin page.</p> <p>You can define catch-all rules and have them executed last to consume any documents not matched by previous rules.

However, it is up to you to use them in a way that helps you organize documents and find specific documents when you need them. This section offers a couple ideas for managing your collection.</p> <p>Document types allow you to classify documents according to what they are. You can define types such as \"Receipt\", \"Invoice\", or \"Contract\". If you used to collect all your receipts in a single binder, you can recreate that system in paperless by defining a document type, assigning documents to that type and then filtering by that type to only see all receipts.</p> <p>Not all documents need document types. Sometimes its hard to determine what the type of a document is or it is hard to justify creating a document type that you only need once or twice. This is okay. As long as the types you define help you organize your collection in the way you want, paperless is doing its job.</p> <p>Tags can be used in many different ways. Think of tags are more versatile folders or binders. If you have a binder for documents related to university / your car or health care, you can create these binders in paperless by creating tags and assigning them to relevant documents. Just as with documents, you can filter the document list by tags and only see documents of a certain topic.</p> <p>With physical documents, you'll often need to decide which folder the document belongs to. The advantage of tags over folders and binders is that a single document can have multiple tags. A physical document cannot magically appear in two different folders, but with tags, this is entirely possible.</p>  <p>Tip</p> <p>This can be used in many different ways. One example: Imagine you're working on a particular task, such as signing up for university. Usually you'll need to collect a bunch of different documents that are already sorted into various folders. With the tag system of paperless, you can create a new group of documents that are relevant to this task without destroying the already existing organization. When you're done with the task, you could delete the tag again, which would be equal to sorting documents back into the folder they belong into. Or keep the tag, up to you.</p>  <p>All of the logic above applies to correspondents as well. Attach them to documents if you feel that they help you organize your collection.</p> <p>When you've started organizing your documents, create a couple saved views for document collections you regularly access. This is equal to having labeled physical binders on your desk, except that these saved views are dynamic and simply update themselves as you add documents to the system.</p> <p>Here are a couple examples of tags and types that you could use in your collection.</p> <ul> <li>An <code>inbox</code> tag for newly added documents that you haven't manually   edited yet.</li> <li>A tag <code>car</code> for everything car related (repairs, registration,   insurance, etc)</li> <li>A tag <code>todo</code> for documents that you still need to do something with,   such as reply, or perform some task online.</li> <li>A tag <code>bank account x</code> for all bank statement related to that   account.</li> <li>A tag <code>mail</code> for anything that you added to paperless via its mail   processing capabilities.</li> <li>A tag <code>missing_metadata</code> when you still need to add some metadata to   a document, but can't or don't want to do this right now.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"usage/#basic-usage_searching","title":"Searching","text":"<p>Paperless offers an extensive searching mechanism that is designed to allow you to quickly find a document you're looking for (for example, that thing that just broke and you bought a couple months ago, that contract you signed 8 years ago).</p> <p>When you search paperless for a document, it tries to match this query against your documents. Paperless will look for matching documents by inspecting their content, title, correspondent, type and tags.

However, paperless also offers advanced search syntax if you want to drill down the results further.</p> <p>Matching documents with logical expressions:</p> <pre><code>shopname AND (product1 OR product2)\n</code></pre> <p>Matching specific tags, correspondents or types:</p> <pre><code>type:invoice tag:unpaid\ncorrespondent:university certificate\n</code></pre> <p>Matching dates:</p> <pre><code>created:[2005 to 2009]\nadded:yesterday\nmodified:today\n</code></pre> <p>Matching inexact words:</p> <pre><code>produ*name\n</code></pre>  <p>Note</p> <p>Inexact terms are hard for search indexes.

On a modern multi core system, this   makes the consumption process with full OCR blazingly fast.</p> <p>The task processor comes with a built-in admin interface that you   can use to check whenever any of the tasks fail and inspect the   errors (i.e., wrong email credentials, errors during consuming a   specific file, etc).</p> <ul> <li> <p>A redis message broker: This is a really   lightweight service that is responsible for getting the tasks from   the webserver and the consumer to the task scheduler. These run in a   different process (maybe even on different machines!), and   therefore, this is necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: A database server. Paperless supports PostgreSQL, MariaDB   and SQLite for storing its data.</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
